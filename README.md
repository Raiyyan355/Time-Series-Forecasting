## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Project Title**: NVIDIA Stock Price Forecasting (Time Series)
- **Objective**: Forecast NVIDIA stock prices based on 365 days of historical open price data.
- **Model Used**: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Key Result**: Achieved Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of approximately **4.8**.
- **Visualization**: Trends and predictions were visualized using **Matplotlib**.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: NVIDIA Historical Stock Price Data (CSV file used)
- **Columns Used**: 
  - `Date` (Timestamp)
  - `Open` (Opening stock price)
- **Resampling**: Daily frequency with missing value handling.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` - Visualization
  - `statsmodels` - ARIMA modeling
  - `sklearn` - Evaluation metrics

---

## üìù Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset and converted `Date` to datetime format.
   - Set `Date` as index and selected the `Open` price column.
   - Resampled the data to daily frequency, forward-filling any missing values.

2. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the data into:
     - **Training Set**: 80% of the data.
     - **Test Set**: 20% of the data.

3. **Model Building: ARIMA**
   - Chose ARIMA parameters `(p=5, d=2, q=0)` based on empirical performance.
   - Trained the model on the training data.

4. **Forecasting**
   - Generated predictions on the test set using the fitted ARIMA model.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Calculated **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: **4.8**

6. **Visualization**
   - Plotted:
     - Training data
     - Actual stock prices
     - Predicted stock prices

## üìä Results

| Metric | Value  |
|--------|--------|
| RMSE   | 4.8    |

- The model demonstrated reasonable accuracy in forecasting NVIDIA stock prices over the test period.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted values showed that the ARIMA model captured overall trends effectively.

---

## üí° Key Learnings

- Time series forecasting requires careful data preparation, including resampling and stationarity checks.
- ARIMA models can effectively capture trends in financial time series but are sensitive to parameter tuning.
- Visualization is essential for assessing model performance beyond numerical metrics.
